## Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that utilizes cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units.
"Cryptocurrency in its purest form is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash. It allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going
through a financial institution.” [^bolt17bitcoin]
Therefore this currency is often based on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers. 
Unlike traditional fiat currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks. In the concept of computing, decentralized networks mean
“the allocation of hard and software resources and the majority of the associated activities and functions are not carried out, obtained or stored
in a centralized location.” [^lee18inclusive] In simpler terms, this decentralized nature works through a computer network that allows for peer-to-peer transactions
that are not reliant on one central authority like the government or banks. 

Cryptocurrencies do not have any government-mandated or inherent value assigned to them.
Instead, their worth is entirely determined by market demand and the price that buyers and sellers are willing to agree upon during transactions.
This means their value can fluctuate significantly based on factors such as investor interest, public perception, and overall market conditions.
Therefore “a cryptocurrency is more useful when more people use it, then benefits are maximized when everybody adopts the same cryptocurrency. Until now, Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency”[^bolt17bitcoin] 
which is the first cryptocurrency that existed and the most commonly traded. Bitcoin was founded in 2009, and invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, which is widely assumed 
to be a pseudonym name for an individual or group as  their identity is unknown. Bitcoin itself is run using an open source software “It is not only decentralized
but also supposedly fully distributed. That means that every node or computer terminal is connected to each other.”[^lee15handbook] Interestingly enough it can be downloaded by anyone.

Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency but it is the most popular. Alternative cryptocurrencies (called “altcoins”) 
numerous others exist, e.g., Namecoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, or Dogecoin, etc. [^bolt17bitcoin]
However, after Bitcoin, some of the most popular are Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) and many more.
