## Biometrics 

Biometrics refers to the use of the physical or behaivour characteristics for identifiying 
and verifie individuals, unlike the traditional methods od authentication like passwords or a key, biometric
focus on who you are, this traits such as fingerprints, iris patterns, voice recognition and 
facial features. biometrics began to take shape in the late 20th century. Biometrics plays a 
critical role in security, in high level authentication is necessary.[^Yingzi12Bi]

Biometrics has had a influence on digital culture, particulary in the terms of security, and 
privacy concerns with the use of biometric authentication the convenience of accessing new systems
and services has drasticallly improved. However this also introduces privacy risk, raising 
serious concerns about data security and surveillance.[^Arte08Bi]

such as examples can be: 

Fingerprint Recognition: Used extensively in smartphones (e.g., Apple's Touch ID), laptops, and secure facilities.

Voice Recognition: Common in virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google Assistant.

Iris Scanning: Used in high-security environments, such as government agencies or military settings, for identification.[^Centre21BiCa]

Biometrics can implied different challenges since it cannot be accesible to everyone. For 
instance, not all individuals may be able to use biometric systems effectevely due to physical 
disabilities. The collection of the data storage and use can lead legal and ethical concerns. 
Without proper regulation, individuals may be subjected to excessive surveillance.
