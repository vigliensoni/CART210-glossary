## Date Science

Data science is the procedure of using scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and information 
from data. It combines expertise in statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to analyze large datasets, uncover 
patterns, and make predictions. The objective is to help associations and companies make informed, data-driven decisions,
to uncover their target audience and commercialize within a specific algorithm. [^dhar13data]

In new media, data science allows for the analysis of large datasets generated by user interactions, helping platforms 
like Netflix, Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube optimize content delivery and advertising strategies. The ability to process
and interpret big data allows for more personalizedexperiences and real-time trend forecasting, which is important in
navigating user engagement and maximizing revenue. [^sweeney13discrimination]

Data science is closely tied to contemporary technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data 
frameworks. These technologies support automated processes, content recommendation algorithms, and targeted advertising. 
For example, Netflix uses data science to recommend shows, while Facebook tailors ads tospecific user demographics, 
both approaches shaping the way media is consumed and monetized. [^gomez-uribe,hunt15algorythm]
