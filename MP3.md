## MP3

MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3) is a widely used digital audio format that has revolutionized the way people store, distribute, and consume music. MP3 is a lossy audio compression format that significantly reduces file size while maintaining acceptable sound quality by discarding audio data that is not sensitive to human hearing. This efficient compression makes MP3 key to the rise of digital music, online distribution, and portable media players, and has profoundly influenced contemporary digital culture and media consumption practices[^1].

The importance of MP3 in new media is that it changed the economic model of the music industry, making file sharing and music streaming platforms possible. It is directly related to the evolution of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, digital rights management (DRM), and streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music[^2].

The MP3 format was developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Its core figure was Karlheinz Brandenburg, who achieved efficient compression by optimizing perceptual coding techniques to remove parts of the audio signal that are imperceptible to the human ear[^3].

MP3 became widely known in the late 1990s, with the rise of the Internet and peer-to-peer file sharing services such as Napster (launched in 1999), which enabled the mass dissemination of digital music. This triggered a major conflict between copyright holders and consumers, and fundamentally changed the music industry's thinking about digital rights management and profit models[^4].
