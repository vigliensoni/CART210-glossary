## Multimedia

Multimedia refers to the application of multiple media working in parrallel to deliver a more engaging message than one single form of media.[^gartner31multimedia] By manipulating text, images, 
data and videos through technology (both modern and traditional forms), one may allow more dimension for expression.

Multimedia is thought to date back to the early 1960's, with interactive installations such as Ivan Sutherland and Bob Sproull's "The Ultimate Display".[^history30ultimate] The proposed installation involved a computer interpreting beams of light and outputting them into a small screen on a helmet.[^brown17virtual] 
The Ultimate Display was effectively the ancestor of modern virtual reality technologies, combining creative computation, physics and imagery to generate virtual objects. The term "multimedia" was allegedly coined later in 1966 by singer songwriter Bob Goldsteinn,
to promote a visual jukebox he called "lightworks".[^information30coins] With the evolution of software and hardware in the 20th and 21st centuries, interactive programs like video games and social media emerged as some of the most commercial and prevalent forms of multimedia entertainment.
