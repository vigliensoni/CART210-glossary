## Cultural Determinism 

Cultural determinism is the theory that human behavior, identity, and group dynamics are shaped primarily by cultural factors[^OxCul] such as norms, beliefs, and values.
It reflects that a person's or group's social context, including their cultural construction, determines how they perceive the world, behave, and interpret experiences.
This framework suggests that mental illness, social roles, and even individual actions are products of cultural expectations rather than biological or normal factors [^Meford01Cult]. 
Cultural determinism often critiques the idea that behavior is biologically determined, proposing instead that it is molded by the societal and cultural systems within which individuals live.

Cultural determinism is especially relevant in the context of digital technologies and platforms. 
In virtual environments, identities and norms are often constructed and reinforced through algorithms[^Mike80Cult] that prioritize certain types of content, reinforcing specific cultural ideals. 
Social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, exemplify how cultural values around body image, success, and lifestyle are propagated and amplified. 

Cultural determinism in the digital medium also raises controversial questions about free will, personal autonomy, and the power of technology in shaping behavior.
