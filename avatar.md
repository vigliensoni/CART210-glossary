## Glossary Definitions 01: Avatar
The term ‘avatar’ is not a new concept. According to the Myriam Webster dictionary, it comes from the Sanskrit word referring to a deity's descent or incarnation on earth, and later evolved to refer to any embodiment or personification of an idea, entity or philosophy [^MiramWebster01Defintion]. However, more recently, the first thing that comes to mind when we hear the word avatar is closer to B. Coleman’s definition in her book *Hello Avatar*, where she describes them as “a computer-generated figure controlled by a person via a computer. It is often a graphical representation of a person with which one can interact in real time” [^Coleman].
	Coleman, however, expands further on her definition, adding that the avatar also "includes the many modes of representation we employ that make up the different roles we play and places we go"[^Coleman].  Jerry Liu explains is his article “From Sci Fi to Commercialization: The Rise of Digital Avatars,” that the idea of an avatar is not just referencing the self, but also “digital influencers” and “digital celebrities”, including examples such as 1990s band *The Gorillaz*, international digital superstar Hatsune Miku and AI created influencers such as Lil Miquella[^Liu]. 
	Avatar, then, is not only referring now to the way one chooses to represent oneself within a game world, but is quickly evolving to also encompass entire personalities and independent characters divorced from any real life person. Yet, despite them existing in the digital world, they are not free from human scrutiny and bias. In a real-world experiment, the behaviour of multiple individuals and avatars were observed, the results being that "Participants assigned to more attractive avatars were more intimate with confederates in a self-disclosure and interpersonal distance task than participants assigned to less attractive avatars. Participants assigned to taller avatars behaved more confidently in a negotiation task than participants assigned to shorter avatars."[^PanSteed01]
	As technology grows and evolves within new media spaces, the definition of what is simply an ‘avatar’ and what is an entirely new entity (in the case of AI influencers, for example) become blurred. The question of what is ‘real’ identity within digital spaces will only continue to become more and more complex.
