Virtuality refers to how we live, work, and interact through digital technology, like the internet, video games, social media, and other online platforms.
Today, many parts of our lives such as work, relationships, entertainment, and even self-care happen online.
This virtual world is shaped by different technologies, such as gaming software, social networks, and online communication tools.
These technologies create new ways for people to interact and experience life.
For example, in video games like World of Warcraft, players connect through various digital tools like blogs,
forums, and chat rooms, making the game more than just the software itself. [^nardi15virtuality]


Virtual worlds like online games and platforms are spaces where artists experiment with creating and showcasing art in digital environments. 
These spaces let artists explore new ways of interacting with their audience and blending physical and virtual worlds.
Over time, virtual art has been presented in galleries and exhibitions, encouraging collaboration and new forms of expression. [^doyle15art] 
Artists use these virtual spaces to reimagine art, create immersive experiences, and explore social engagement in unique ways that wouldn't be possible in the physical world.


Virtuality is the idea that something can have an effect or be experienced even if it isn't physically real.
For instance, in a meeting where most committee members aren't physically there, the meeting can still happen because everyone is "virtually" present,
maybe through video calls or other digital tools. Even though the people aren't in the same room,
their presence is still felt, and the meeting can go on as planned. [^norton72what]
Virtuality is powerful because it can fill in for what’s missing in the real world and still allow things to function as if they were real.
It helps us continue with important activities, even if the real-world conditions aren't perfect.
