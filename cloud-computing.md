## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing touches on the delivery of computing services through the internet. These services include storage, databases, networking, servers, software and analytics. Before cloud computing, the only way to access these resources is through physical hardware and computers. With cloud computing, users can enjoy a fast and flexible experience with these services without the need of any physical components. Although cloud computing offers versatility and adaptability, it uses a pay-as-you-go model that lets the user pay a fixed amount depending on their usage of the product. [^mell2011]

Key characteristics of cloud computing includes: 
-	Self-service: Users can use these services without the need of any human interaction.
-	Accessibility: Users can access these services through various devices.
-	Monitored data: Statistics are consistently monitored 
-	Resource allocation: Everything is much more efficient and cost effective since these resources are only activated for you when it is being used. When the user is done with the service, it is pulled away. [^mell2011]

Types of Cloud Computing Models:
-	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Like Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, these services give users access to virtual versions of hardware like networks etc. Like renting a computer instead of owning a physical hardware. [^armbrust2010]
-	Software as a Service (SaaS): Services such as Microsoft 365 is part of SaaS. This is a software delivery structure that allows user to interact with applications remotely through their web browser. Mostly on a subscription plan, these services give user the freedom to use their applications without having to download them directly onto to their computers. [^buyya2013]
-	Platform as a Service (PaaS): Like Google App Engine, these services grants users the ability to build, run and manage applications without the having to own their own hardware. [^buyya2013]
