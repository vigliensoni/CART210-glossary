## post-Humanism 
Emerging in the late 20th and 21st centuries, posthumanism critiques Eurocentric humanism, which positions humans at the center of the universe, and explores the interdependence of all matter—humans, animals, plants, and technology.[^K23Post]

Post-humanism can also be connected to the science fiction portrayal of superheroes who use technology to enhance their abilities, blurring the line between human and non-human [^Paul23Trans]. 
These technologies—ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) to advanced robotics—are shaping society by providing access to amounts of information and expanding human intelligence.
As these technologies evolve, they challenge traditional human capabilities, fundamentally altering the nature of consciousness itself. 

Post-humanism is significant in the context of current technologies because innovations like AI are transforming how people think and process information, accelerating cognitive abilities in ways that were impossible. 
The rise of AI, for instance, allows humans to interact with and analyze information faster, opening up new avenues for creativity and problem-solving.
This shift is fundamentally reshaping what it means to be human, pushing beyond the biological limits and revaluating human capacity in the digital age. 

As post-humanism becomes more intertwined with technological development [^Scott16The], it challenges the categorization of human vs. non-human
and raises questions about fairness, equality, and the ethics of technological enhancements.
