## Compression 

Compression is a word used in many domains and can be summed up as “the act of pressing something into a smaller space or putting pressure on it from different sides until it gets smaller”. [^CambridgeDictionary] 
In the new media space, it is more commonly known as data compression which can be defined as “the process of converting a source data into a smaller sized version of it”. [^Salomon02]
While there are many ways to compress data, they can be categorized as either [lossy](../main/glossary.md#lossy) or [lossless](../main/glossary.md#lossless). 

While it is impossible to give credit to a specific individual, 
an early example of compression can be attributed to Samuel Morse and the Morse code when he decided to “assign shorter codes for the most common letters in the English alphabet, 
such as ‘A' and ‘E’, to help transmit messages quickly”. [^Sayood02]

Compression is important in media spaces as it helps to solve two major problems,
the first being the need for storage space and the second is to allow users to share and view content rapidly. [^Salomon02]

Data compression is becoming more and more relevant in the tech industry as the rise of [Artificial-Intelligence](../main/glossary.md#artificial-intelligence)  services requires faster and more efficient ways to be able to transmit images and data. [^Tsukuba24] 
As such, new algorithms are being developed and published like the “Universal Adaptive Stream-Based Entropy Coding” system to aid in this issue [^Shinichi24].

Compression is also present in current-day media through short-form content such as TikTok and Instagram Reels as well as TV and movie scenes length decreasing over time. 
This includes content on YouTube containing jump cuts and the removal of silent pauses during speech. 
This type of compression could be linked to the lowered attention span that our society is currently facing with the increase in the amount of content available 
due to having more space or from the short content duration format. [^Mills23]
