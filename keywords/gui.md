## GUI

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is the interface of current computers. Usually portrayed as symbols, buttons, or pointing devices, to allow the user to easily communicate with a computer [^levy24gui]. A well designed GUI facilitates navigation, efficiency, and practicality of a software to the average computer user [^jansen98gui].

However, information was not always graphically displayed and as easy to navigate through as it is today. Early users would communicate with computers by “batch processing” [^reimer05gui]. They would write out all details of a task on punch cards then feed it to the computer which would return the results within an hour or more [^levy24gui]. The GUI concept originates from Douglas Engelbart, an electrical engineer and inventor, who envisioned a display system with graphical information which the user could jump around from [^reimer05gui]. It was not until 1962 that his ideas were published in an essay titled “Augmenting Human Intellect” and then developed the technology to present a public demonstration in 1968 [^reimer05gui]. Nearly 10 years later, Xerox Star was the first application created with a GUI design [^jansen98gui]. Steve Jobs caught wind of this development and hired some of the same designers to create Apple Lisa for Apple Computer [^jansen98gui]. These first designs were not commercially successful until Jobs’ project Apple Macintosh [^jansen98gui]. The GUI we see and use today strongly roots back to the GUI found in Macintosh.
