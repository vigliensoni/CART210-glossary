## JPEG

JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)[^JPEG] is a file format commonly used to compress and store images. It is reffered to as a 
"lossy" format because it compresses and alters the pixel data of the file and is therefore not a "lossless" transfer. It was created in
1992 by the aptly named Joint Photographic Experts Group and they are widely credited with the proliferation of digital imaging with its ease 
of use and storing. 

Though the data loss through JPEG compreession can be severe in some cases, it is mostly considered to be a worthwhile sacrifice for the 
amount of space it saves. Even though more formats have since been released and popularized (such as Apple's HEIC format or the PNG format) 
the JPEG format remains the ol' reliable of image compression. 

The method that JPEG takes to compression uses the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) method by discarding high-frequency information (such as intense
hues and dense packets of data. By discarding this data, it then fills the gap using existing data leading to a lossy compression where high-frequency details
are lost and filled in with random data, creating nosie or grain.
