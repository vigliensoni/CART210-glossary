## Open Source

The term “open source” refers to the source code of a project that is under an open source licence and is freely available for anyone to inspect, modify and redistribute [^opensource]. For source code to be considered open source, it must adhere to the Open Source Definition (OSD) created by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). This definition was written by Bruce Perens and acts as a bill of rights for users by certifying content as open source [^bruceperens].

The current criteria outlined by the Open Source Definition are as such:

The license must allow for free redistribution of the source code/content.
The content must include source code and allow for redistribution in form of source code.
The license must allow for modifications and for derived works to be redistributed under the same terms as the original license.
The license may require derived works to be distributed under a different name or version number to maintain the integrity of the original project.
The license must not discriminate against any group of people.
The license must not restrict usage in any field or endeavor.
The license must apply to all cases of use without the need of additional licenses.
The license must not be limited to particular software distribution.
The license must not impose restrictions on any other software used in the redistribution of the content.
The license must not be specific to any software, style or interface. [^bruceperens]

The concept of collaboratively developing a project with source code freely available to modify and redistribute was first introduced through the GNU project at MIT in the early 1980’s. In early 1998 the term “open source” was coined by Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond in response to the source code of the Netscape web browser being released [^cristinagacek]. This soon led to the establishment of the Open Source Initiative and the official Open Source Definition to create clear guidelines as to what qualifies as open source. 

A well-known example of open source software is Linux, an open source operating system based on the Linux kernel released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds [^linux]. Linux quickly gained popularity and replaced software with much more restrictive licenses, especially as the World Wide Web emerged and the internet became more mainstream [^ericramond]. Linux demonstrated the benefits of open source software due to its rapid development, and the open source license encouraged developers to feel comfortable while contributing to it.

Although the term originated from a software context and is most commonly used in said context, the open source concept extends onto many other fields such as art, education and research. Open Source recognizes developers as a part of  the user community [^cristinagacek], and emphasises the importance of collaboration and community in innovation.
